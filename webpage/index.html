        <h3>the project</h3>
        <p>accelerometers have been used for a variety of applications; we're interested in seeing what they can tell us about dancers</p>
        
        <h3>goals & research questions</h3>
        <p>We can collect data from a variety of sources (dance teams on campus, experienced dancers vs. non-dancers) and see if we can find distinct patterns. First, however, we have some questions to investigate, like: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is a dance? Can we identify dancing as a specific activity?</li>
            <li>Can we distinguish these dance styles from each other?</li>
            <li>How do we represent accelerometer data to other humans in a way that's useful and meaningful?</li>
            <li>How do you do this in real time? Dancing happens over time, so a single data point doesn't tell us much about the overall activity.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>process</h3>
        <p>We started our project by just collecting lots of different accelerometer data. this set us up for doing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to </p>

        <h3>results</h3>
        
        <h3>next steps</h3>
