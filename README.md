###the project
accelerometers have been used for a variety of applications; we're interested in seeing what they can tell us about dancers
        
###goals & research questions
We can collect data from a variety of sources (dance teams on campus, experienced dancers vs. non-dancers) and see if we can find distinct patterns. First, however, we have some questions to investigate, like:
- What is a dance? Can we identify dancing as a specific activity?
-Can we distinguish these dance styles from each other?
-How do we represent accelerometer data to other humans in a way that's useful and meaningful?
-How do you do this in real time? Dancing happens over time, so a single data point doesn't tell us much about the overall activity.
        
###process
We started our project by just collecting lots of different accelerometer data. this set us up for doing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to
